	   <p> Climbing is both an individualistic and social sport: when you're on the rock you can only count on your skills to get to the top. If you do fall however, you'll have to trust your climbing partner with your life. Beyond question. No mistakes allowed. This often makes for very strong bonds and relationships.<a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/Articles/Introduction_to_Climbing/Picking_up_climbing_-_Part_1_Introduction_Overview_1.html">Click here to learn more</a>

	<h2>A website that has the same topic</h2>
	Click <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/">Here</a>
	<p>This rockclimbing.com website has many tags that link to other page content ont the top, which makes it very organized and easy for the users to find what they are looking for. 

	When checking out the source, I recognized some HTML elements, like link, meta, head, title, and etc. one of the tag I don`t recognize is the script tag, I guess it is something that define what script is using to edit this website. 

	<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp">definition</a> on W3Schools.com,<dfn>Script Element</dfn> either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute. Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
